## Overview

The Vibes Backend is a robust and scalable server-side application designed to handle real-time communication and user management for the Vibes platform. Built using Node.js and Express, it leverages MongoDB for data storage and Socket.IO for real-time event handling. This backend service is responsible for managing user authentication, chat functionalities, and administrative operations.

## Features

- **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, profile management, and authentication.
- **Chat System**: Supports one-on-one and group chats with real-time messaging capabilities.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides administrative functionalities for managing users and monitoring chat activities.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Utilizes Socket.IO to deliver instant notifications and updates.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary Account (for image uploads)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibes-backend.git
   cd vibes-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your_admin_secret_key
```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 3000).

2. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the backend API.

## Development Guide

- **Code Style**: Follow the standard JavaScript coding conventions and use ESLint for linting.
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests using Jest or Mocha.
- **Contributing**: Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is essential for understanding and utilizing the backend services effectively. Consider using tools like Swagger or Postman to generate and maintain comprehensive API docs.

## Testing

Ensure robust testing of the application by implementing unit tests for individual components and integration tests for end-to-end scenarios. Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha, and consider setting up continuous integration with tools like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running and the URI is correct.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Verify that Socket.IO is correctly configured and there are no network issues.
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check the `.env` file for missing or incorrect variables.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Use JWT for secure token-based authentication.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **CORS**: Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins.
- **Environment Variables**: Keep sensitive information secure by using environment variables.
